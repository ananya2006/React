                <h3>React is a declarative language created by engineers at facebooks to make app organisation and designing easier.
                    A declarative language is a language which allows us to tell the components in the app. JavaScript is an imperative 
                    and Html is a declarative language. It was created by the engineers to make a complex application in a simple and easy way. It combines both languages, JavaScript and 
                    Html to code.
